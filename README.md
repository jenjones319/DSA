401 Data Structures and Algorithms

## Challenge Summary: Challenge 1 - Reverse an Array
* Using C# and VS, write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Challenge Description
* This challenge relies on translating for loops and arrays effectively in C#, based on prior knowledge in .js.

## Approach & Efficiency
Using for loops, return an array, then return another array in reverse. 

## Solution
This one I didn't have a whiteboard image. 



## Challenge Summary: Challenge 2 - Shift an Array + Add a Number 

* Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Challenge Description: 

* This challenge relies on taking in a number, finding the middle of an array, and returning a new array with the additional number included. 

## Approach & Efficiency
* I used knowledge I had previously about how to add a spot for a new number, find the middle of an array, and return a new array with the additional int inserted.

## Challenge Summary: Challenge 3 - Binary Search 

* Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key.

## Challenge Description: 

* This challenge builds on existing knowledge about arrays in C#, and adds to it with sorting and search. 

## Approach & Efficiency
* I used knowledge I had previously about how to sort an array, and practiced new knowledge using a search key. 

## Solution
I didn't have a whiteboard solution for this one. 

## Challenge Summary: Challenge 5 - Linked Lists
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Challenge Description
* This challenges provides practice for linked lists

## Approach & Efficiency
* Using methods insert, include, and to string. 

## Solution
* This one I didn't have a whiteboard image. 

## Challenge Summary: Challenge 6 - Linked List Insertions
* Write methods for append, insert before, and insert after. 

## Challenge Description
* This challenges provides practice for adding into linked lists

## Approach & Efficiency
* Use methods that append, insert nodes before, and insert nodes after in a list.

## Challenge Summary: Challenge 8 - Linked List Zip
* Write a function and zip two lists together into one. 

## Challenge Description
* This challenges provides practice for zipping two linked lists.

## Approach & Efficiency
* Use methods that zip two lists together, using nodes and linked lists built in prior challenges.
